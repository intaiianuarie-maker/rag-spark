# MUSER Loop State — Super RAG v1→v2→v3→v4 (Contabo)

> Coordinator: museR (sole merge/deploy authority per user 2026-10-12).
> Coder: Dev1 (`w5:p2`). Sequential: v1 → v2 → v3 → v4. Loop runs until V4 done.
> Controlling review: `knowledge-os-jury-review-20261012/REVIEW-REPORT.md`
> (REQUEST CHANGES, QF-01–QF-17) + `ISSUES-REMEDIATION-PLAN.md` (RP-01–RP-17).
> This file is the compaction-safe resume point. Dev1's living memory:
> `handoffs/CODE1-HANDOFF.md` (Dev1 appends per slice; museR verifies).

## User standing directives (2026-10-12)
1. Small slices, fast coding/review cycle (one prompt ≈ one shippable fix).
2. Morning V1/V2 jury review is the gate source of truth.
3. Handoffs always current (Dev1: CODE1-HANDOFF.md; museR: this file).
4. Fresh Dev1 session per task (`/clear` before each new dispatch).
5. Context >50% → rely on on-disk state (this file + handoffs), keep prompts short.
6. Loop runs until V4 done. V3/V4 start only after V1+V2 acceptance.

## Slice backlog — V1 (micro-tickets: `rag-fork-solution/tasks/MICRO-TICKETS-V1.md`)
Board: http://127.0.0.1:8095/ (`Super Rag/kanban/index.html`, state `tasks/micro-tickets-state.json`).
Ticket order = build order. museR moves states; board auto-refreshes 60s.
| Slice | RP/QF | Scope (one reviewable unit) | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0 | stage-0 | Pin revision, reconcile jury QFs vs HEAD `46fbf67`+dirty | DOING (museR) |

## V2 (after V1 Q9 gate passes, graph flag off parity)
| Slice | RP | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| G-a | RP-04 | Graph extraction wiring via seam + persistence/config | GATED |
| G-b | RP-03-graph | Graph canonical citations (no summary-as-source) | GATED |
| G-c | RP-05 | Paired real-answer eval (external model runs) | GATED |

## V3 / V4 (after V1+V2 acceptance + explicit user dispatch)
- V3 agents+research: `V3-AGENTS-RESEARCH-PLAN.md` (A0–A5/R0–R2). GATED.
- V4 workflows: `V4-WORKFLOWS-PLAN.md` (W0–W7). Existing W0/W1 preserved, paused. GATED.

## Cycle protocol (every slice) — FLOW v2 (2026-10-12, museR authorized to improve)
1. museR: `/clear` Dev1 session, send ONE slice prompt: scope + files + binary acceptance (exact commands) + handoff format + 20-min time-box ("if blocked, report partial + blocker, don't spin").
2. Dev1: implement, focused tests, append `CODE1-HANDOFF.md` (TASK/CHANGE/WHY/REUSED/BUILT/VERIFY/RISKS), reply done. No commit/deploy/restart.
3. museR: run focused checks, commit immediately (shrink dirty surface; I own merge).
4. PIPELINE: fresh-subagent reviewer verifies the immutable commit while Dev1 (fresh `/clear` session) starts the next slice. Fix-ups become new micro-slices if review says REQUEST-CHANGES.
5. Deploy: restart only the affected service (`docker compose up -d <svc>`), curl `/health`+`/ready`; full-stack restart only on compose/infra change. Update this ledger + TASKS.md row per slice.
6. STUCK RULE: Dev1 `working` + no handoff/diff change for 15 min → one status nudge, never a duplicate task prompt.
7. No slice merges unrelated refactors. No reviewer session reused across slices.
- ~14:15 UTC: Dev1 Did not stop on esc/stop-prompt (diff 37→40, 3 runaway files). ctrl+c killed
  the session (pane back to clean shell, agent gone). Reverted 5 runaway paths (pg_fts.py,
  qdrant_store.py, errors.py, 2 tests); diff back to 35 (34 + this ledger). Fresh `dev1`
  started in w5:p2. ALLOCATION STARTED: T-V1-001 dispatched (docstring fix, solo, 15-min box).

## Log
- 2026-10-12 ~13:55 UTC: loop founded. Host vmi3584180/root verified. Stack healthy (api/worker/pg/redis/qdrant/seaweedfs/infinity). HEAD 46fbf67 +20M/14U dirty (F2/F3/F5/F6 in flight per CODE1-HANDOFF round2). ITER1 dispatched to Dev1 (stabilization evidence, no commit). Awaiting Dev1 idle.
- ~14:10 UTC: parallel reviews landed. Review-A (backend F2/F3/F5): APPROVE + 3 nits (test rename trivial; infinity 5xx-as-reachable low → `<500` fix; graph-purger re-eval low, pre-existing QF-04). Review-B (answer F6/classifier/trace): REQUEST-CHANGES minor → queued as micro-slices: B1 models.py content-guarantee vs legacy no-grounder path (MED); B2 verification.py docstring contradiction (LOW); B3 dead _citation helper (INFO); B4 add graph-path + store-grounder content tests (MED). Noted: QF-06 untouched by trace-panel change; QF-16 fail-closed still open (not claimed).
